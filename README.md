# How to guide

*The repo consists of the following files:*

#Assignment 1:

- **cdn-domain-name.txt** [This file consist of the first assignment required cdn domain names]

**Note**: I tried multiple times to create origin for the second S3 bucket to access the /devops-folder/ link, but not sure for what reasons this is not working as expected, I can definitely route you along on what I did to setup, and I think I did the way it should, but may be I am missing something, not sure.

#Assignment 2: 

- **count-ip.ps1** [Powershell script which can be run on powershell directly]
- **count.exe** [Executable file, the expected file for the assignment, on running it will generate an ***output.txt*** file which contains the result in the format required]
-**expected-output.txt** [This is the expected output file, for reference]
- **logfile.txt** [The provided logfile for the assignment]
